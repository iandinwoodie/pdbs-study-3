# Loading the Data

The raw data is included in the data directory. However, since some data needed
to be cleaned manually, we start from the manually cleaned data. We load the
data and verify its dimensions and structure.

```{r}
# TODO: Replace "mock-manual.csv" with "manual.csv" when it is available.
df <- read.csv('../data/mock-manual.csv', header=TRUE, skipNul=TRUE)
dim(df)
str(df)
```

We see that we have 963 responses across 484 fields.

# Final Summary

Take a last look at the data before saving it to disk.

```{r}
dim(df)
summary(df)
```

# Saving the Tidy Data

Save the data to a file in RDS format so that the data types are saved and so
that the output is compressed.

```{r}
saveRDS(df, '../data/tidy.Rds')
```
